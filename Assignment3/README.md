# Clustering Assignment – DBSCAN, k-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering

This repository contains the code and visualizations for a clustering comparison assignment. The main goal of the project is to compare the performance of three clustering algorithms:

- **DBSCAN**
- **k-Means**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

## Overview

The code applies all three clustering methods on two datasets:

1. **make_moons** – a dataset with non-spherical clusters (good for DBSCAN)
2. **make_blobs** – with varying densities (DBSCAN struggles here)

Each method is evaluated using:
- Visual plots
- Silhouette score (when applicable)
- Observations about performance and limitations

## Files and Folders

- `clustering_analysis.py` – Main Python script with clustering code
- `plots/` – Folder containing saved images of clustering results
- `README.md` – Overview of the project and instructions
